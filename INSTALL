REQUIREMENTS
------------

***Languages***

ShoRAH is a collection of programs written in C++ (for which you will need a
compiler), Python (version 2.6 or later, but not Python 3.x) and Perl. They
come with almost any distribution of Linux and Mac OS X, or they can be
downloaded and installed.


***Libraries***

Please download and install:

- Biopython (http://biopython.org/wiki/Download), following the online
  instructions.
- GSL (GNU scientific library) from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/,
  installation is described in the included README and INSTALL files.
- ncurses (required by samtools).

INSTALLATION
------------

Download and extract the gzipped tar archive (shorah-0.x.tar.gz). Change to the
extracted directory, run make.

This should be sufficient in most cases. In case the gsl library is not located
in the standard location, you may have to edit the lines indicated in Makefile.

	'''Find maximum cardinality matching of a bipartite graph (U,V,E).
	The input format is a dictionary mapping members of U to a list
	of their neighbors in V.  The output is a triple (M,A,B) where M is a
	dictionary mapping members of V to their matches in U, A is the part
	of the maximum independent set in U, and B is the part of the MIS in V.
	The same object may occur in both U and V, and is treated as two
	distinct vertices if this happens.'''
